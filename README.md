# Columns Game

## Overview
A Python + Pygame recreation of the classic Columns puzzle game. Players control falling columns of jewels, rotating and moving them to create vertical, horizontal, or diagonal matches of three or more. Includes animations, match detection, and game over logic

## How to Play

* Move the falling column of jewels left or right with the arrow keys.
* Rotate the order of jewels in the column using the spacebar.
* Match three or more jewels of the same color in a row — vertically, horizontally, or diagonally — to clear them from the board.
* New jewels will fall to fill empty spaces after matches.
* The game ends when there’s no space for a new column of jewels.
